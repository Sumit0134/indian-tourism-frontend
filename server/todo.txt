TODO
------
1) Remove the assigning of username to a user. This feature is optional.
2) Implement user data update with feature of image upload.





DONE
-----
1) Implement checking of duplicate email while signing up
2) OTP expiry time implementation.
3) Prevent login until the user has varified the email.
4) Implement refresh token functionality. It is not sent in the request headers.
5) Fix user logout issue, where if the user is logged in anywhere, and tried to login from another device,
the user should be logged out from the first device. Mechanism to be used is -> Storing the refresh token
in the database, and checking if the refresh token is present in the database, if not, then the user is logged out.
5) Implement password reset functionality.
6) Create a helper function to consolidate all JWT tasks in one place.






Later
